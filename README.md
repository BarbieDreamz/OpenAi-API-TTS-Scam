# OpenAi-API-TTS-Scam
Python Script using OpenAI API to compare the speech audio used in a phone scam.

The scammer wrote a script and used the OpenAI text to speech voice options to create audio for their scam. The scammer then calls the individual and leaves a voicemail.

These can be used for real-time but that is not what happened during my investigation.

Information related to the direct scam is redacted. I opted to use a python script to interact with the API and output an audio file.

This assumes your environment is setup properly and you have API keys from your OpenAI account.
